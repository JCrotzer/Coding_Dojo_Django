# Coding Dojo Python (Django)
### Using python in a robust MTV (Model, Template, View) Framework

#### In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Django.
#### Main concepts were:
* ##### What is an MVC framework?
* ##### What benefits would we gain by using an MVC or MTV framework?
* ##### Redirect to other routes
* ##### Render specific templates
* ##### Invoke methods attached to other pieces of our app that we characterize as models
* ##### Build database tables
* ##### Handle logic related to database operations, including validation

  > Do NOT have a single URL handle BOTH the POST submission as well as the rendering of the html. In other words, never render on a post.  
  
  >- Start Django app from scratch
  >- Reinforce the important concepts you want to master
  >- Get you to build things a lot faster as each iteration will help you optimize your workflow

* ##### Time Display
