#### In this section we covered how python can be used to create full-scale web applications with the help of the Django.
#### Main concepts were:
* ##### What is an MVC framework?
* ##### What benefits would we gain by using an MVC or MTV framework?
* ##### Redirect to other routes

* ##### Invoke methods attached to other pieces of our app that we characterize as models
* ##### Build database tables
* ##### Handle logic related to database operations, including validation
